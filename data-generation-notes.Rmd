Metrics we care about:

* Effect size (% of Social/Display impressions that results in a search)
* Cost per BPSI


(1) The true effect size (% of Social/Display impressions that results in a search) is p.
(2) Geo tests generate estimated effect sizes (95% confidence intervals) for test geos broken out by day
(3) One day's effect size should be independent from another day's effect size. (maybe?)
